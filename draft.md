## My Jam? Planting Strawberry Seeds.

> You take a seat at the table. Everything looks delicious, you can't wait to dive in. Your aunt passes you the salad. "*How is it going at school? Isn't it lonely to be all by yourself?*", she asks. Your eyes still on your plate, your tongue moves by itself. "*It's going fine! I got my diploma last semester*". Small silence. She's still processing. You know where this is going.
"*Oh, very good! I didn't know that. So what are you doing now? Job hunting?*". You still have a couple of seconds, quick find an expl-"*Actually, I've started a PhD!*". Oh no. You went too fast. It's coming any second now. Brace yourself.

Ever since high school, I've always found it pretty difficult to explain what I'm currently studying, be it with friends or family. Now that I've started a PhD at **[IGGI](https://iggi.org.uk/)** (UK), its starting to get trickier. My research subject is about how to "*Generate Coherent and Meaningful New Playable Characters*". Its a very specific topic, at the crossroads of procedural generation, game design, and AI.

If I wanted to explain that to my kind but over-protective aunt, I would need to start by:
1. evidencing that playing games is actually a good thing,
1. that there are people who are trying to make them even better and
1. that we can use computers as creative tools.

Yeah. Not so easy.

But being able to communicate your work to a wide audience is a crucial skill for a researcher. After all, what good can we do to the world, if nobody understands what we're doing? That's why I'm starting this little blog: I want to be able to share all the exciting stuff I'm working on with everyone who'd like to hear a little more about games. How we make them, what they mean to us, and especially, **how games can pleasantly surprise us**.

Going back to that intro story, I believe I finally found a way to explain the core ideas of my research that is accessible, even for my gameoskeptic aunt. The answer was right under my nose, on the table.

### 1.  Playing is Eating

At their core, playing and eating are the same thing. Think about it:

rituals
excuse to share social moment
comfort / stress

everyone has their favorite dishes

### 2.  Design is Cooking





### 3. Generating is Planting
